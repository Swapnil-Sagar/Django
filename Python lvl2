    #Local
    >>>lambda x: x**2
    
    #Enclosing Function Locals
    >>>name = 'This is a global name'
    
        def greet():
          name = "Sagar"
          
          def hello():
            print("hello"+name)
          
          hello()
       
       greet()
       print(name)
    
    
    #Global 
      defined outside the function
      
    #Built-in 
      Pre defined function which should not be redefined
      eg: len
